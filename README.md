## Instructions

To develop the project, the following libraries have been used: FreeGlut, Glew, SOIL, SDL and SDL-mixer, to make sure it will work, we have to install:<br /><br />

<em>sudo apt-get update</em><br />
<em>sudo apt install freeglut3-dev</em><br />
<em>sudo apt install libglew-dev</em><br />
<em>sudo apt install libsoil-dev</em><br />
<em>sudo apt install libsdl1.2-dev</em><br />
<em>sudo apt install libsdl-image1.2-dev</em><br />
<em>sudo apt install libsdl-mixer1.2-dev</em><br />
<em>sudo apt install libsdl-ttf2.0-dev</em><br />

or<br />

<em>sudo apt install freeglut3-dev libglew-dev libsoil-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev</em><br />
